# Hey there
I'm a second year computer science student in IVC, chances are we take a class together!

I *love* web development, so this isn't the only website I've ever created.
Feel free to take a look at everything else I've done:

* [hifumi.io](https://hifumi.io)
* [xetera.dev](https://xetera.dev)
* [and.nowtheweather.com](https://and.nowtheweather.com)

Also I really like [anime](https://anilist.co/user/xetera)

### Why did you do this
I hate all my classes. Turns out forcing myself to take notes in class improves
my attention and attendance **tremendously**. I'm still just a C student,
I just do this because I like the programming part.


### Hit me up
You can find me on these platforms.
