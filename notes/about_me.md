# Hey there
I'm a second year computer science student in IVC, chances are we take a class together!

I *love* web development, I actually love everything about programming and I spend way too
much time working on it instead of doing normal people stuff. This isn't the only website
I've ever created though, feel free to take a look at some other websites I've done if you want.

* [hifumi.io](https://hifumi.io)
* [xetera.dev](https://xetera.dev) <Badge text="WIP" type="warning"/>
* [and.nowtheweather.com](https://and.nowtheweather.com)

Also I really like [anime](https://anilist.co/user/xetera).

### Why did you do this
I hate school as well as all my classes. Turns out forcing myself to take notes in class improves
my attention and attendance **tremendously**. I'm still just a C student,
I just do this because I like the programming part.

### Hit me up
You can find me on these platforms.
