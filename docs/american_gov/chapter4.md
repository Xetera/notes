3. Congress is the most powerful on domestic issues.
4. Congress still has the power to embarrass the president
  * Can conduct investigations of the CIA and of other executive comittes
  * Can refuse to approve of the president's budget and/or severely cut funds.
  * Can refuse to confirm the president's appoint of executive office heads or Supreme Court justices.
  * Can impeach executive officers for wrong-doing, insanity, or incompetence.
  * Congress alone has the right to declare war and ratify treaties, but the president can get around this.
