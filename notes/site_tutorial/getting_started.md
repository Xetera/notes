# So you like the idea of putting your notes online?

Taking notes in class is really boring, but being able to put it online is a huge motivation, at least for me. **You don't have to be a programmer to do this on your own**, you just have to be able to follow instruction (but I mean, it helps if you are one).

## Things you'll need

* A [github](https://github.com) account.
* Basic understanding of [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), it's really not that hard.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Ability to use the terminal without fainting.
* Your own domain, not necessary but helps remember your website's name.

## Installing

1. Make an account on [github](https://github.com).
2. Fork [this website](https://github.com/xetera/notes).
3. Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
4. If you're not a programmer:
  * Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
  * if you are, download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (you should already have this though).
5. Clone your forked repository through the github app.
6. Open up your terminal and navigate to the cloned repsitory.
7. Run the command `npm install -g docsify`
8. Run the command `docsify serve notes`
9. Open up your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
