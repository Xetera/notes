3. Congress is the most powerful on domestic issues.
4. Congress still has the power to embarrass the president
  * Can conduct investigations of the CIA and of other executive comittes
  * Can refuse to approve of the president's budget and/or severely cut funds.
  * Can refuse to confirm the president's appoint of executive office heads or Supreme Court justices.
  * Can impeach executive officers for wrong-doing, insanity, or incompetence.
  * Congress alone has the right to declare war and ratify treaties, but the president can get around this.

![Passing a Law](https://www.lexisnexis.com/help/CU/The_Legislative_Process/bill2law.gif)

#### Points of death
* Speaker of the House
* Committee Chairman (most common point of death)
* Subcommittee Chairman (most common point of death)
* Rules Committee
* Majority Leader

Most bills die in Congress and never become law.

#### Influences of Committees
* If the committee likes the bill they can markup the bill (making it presentable as a legal document).
* Subcommittee can vote to recommend or not recommend the bill, if it's not recommended, it doesn't pass.

> **Quorum** -definition
> 
> The minimum number of members of an assembly that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.

218 house members must be present for the vote to take place.
51 senators are needed for there to be a vote on the bill.

If congress is not in session in 10 days and the bill hasn't been signed, it's a pocket veto.

### Ways to Influence the Bill
* Write the bill (must be sponsored by a Congressman)
* Ask to testify at a committee hearing
* Ask Congressman (letter, e-mail, phone, text) to vote in favor or against a bill
 
### Comments
* Anyone can write a bill but only a congressman can introduce a bill to Congress
* Speaker of the House assigns bill to a committee in the House, President Pro Tempore assigns the bill to a committee in the Senate.
* A bill is not passed in the Congressional session is dead for the rest of the session and cannot be re-introduced.
* A bill can be assigned to several committees.
* Discharge petition or dischrage motion used in the House and Senate to force reporting of a bill to the floor.
* Must have a quorum to vote on a bill (**Senate** 51, **House** 218)
* A bill must pass through both houses in exactly the same form.
* All money bills must originate in the House.

### President's Power over Bills
* Sign the bill, it is now law.
* Leave it on his desk and if after 10 days Congress is still in session, it is law.
* Veto the bill - it is not law unless Congress can over-ride the veto with 2/3rds in each house.
* Do nothing and if Congress adjourns before the 10 days are up, it is a pocket veto.

> [!COMMENT]
> It's fairly common to make quorum... unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

### Facts about Committees
House and Senate have similar committees because they both have to look at similar bills.

Committee and subcommittee chairmen will be members of the majority party.

#### Committee Assignments
* Committee assignments are determined by the party committee of each house.
  * Republicans assign republicals to committees and democrats assign democrats.
* Committee assignments are based on the following:
  * Congressman's seniority
  * Congressman's constituency - where they're from


> [!NOTE]
> The rules committee is the most powerful committee.

#### Different Types of Committees
