# Welcome To My Lair

Hey there, I'm a computer science student and a very experienced slacker 
so I decided to take some notes during class to help myself stay 
motivated to keep coming to class regularly.

Good luck with the studying!

#### FAQ

<br>

Why is the website not updated with the notes from last class? REEEEEEEE

**Answer**: Sometimes the website doesn't refresh properly, make sure you've refreshed manually!

**Answer 2**: Sometimes I'm lazy.

<p style="font-size: 12px">If you're a dev, this is a problem with the service worker and I don't know how to fix it. If you know why this happens, submit a pr on github üò©</p>
