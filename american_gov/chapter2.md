# Timeline of Revolutionary America and the Buildup to the Creation of the Constitution

## 1776 - Declaration of Independence

### Some of the beliefs expressed in the declaration of independences justifying independence: 
- British politicians were corrupt
- Specific complaints against King George III - no taxation without representation
- A government is a government by consent  **NOT** a government by prerogative
  - **Government by Consent**: The people must have the consent of the people - be elected by the people in order to rule
  - **Government by Prerogative**: Rulers are the rulers simply because they have royal blood - they inherited the position 
-  All governments should have a written constitution which specifically grants powers to the government and spells out what the government may legitimately do.

### John Locke's philosophy

  - "A government must have a constitution that grants its citizens natural and inaliable rights that the government cannot infring upon."

  - "Legislative power should be superior to executive power."
