### Powers of Congress
1. Originally the framers of the Constitution intended congress to be the most powerful branch.
2. With the advent of an international presidency and the overall relatively unchecked growth of presidential power, Congress is no longer more powerful than the executive branch but it is more powerful now than it has ever been.
3. Congress is the most powerful on domestic issues.
4. Congress still has the power to embarrass the president
  * Can conduct investigations of the CIA and of other executive comittes
  * Can refuse to approve of the president's budget and/or severely cut funds.
  * Can refuse to confirm the president's appoint of executive office heads or Supreme Court justices.
  * Can impeach executive officers for wrong-doing, insanity, or incompetence.
  * Congress alone has the right to declare war and ratify treaties, but the president can get around this.
