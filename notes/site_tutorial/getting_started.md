# So you like the idea of putting your notes online?

Taking notes in class is really boring, but being able to put it online is a huge motivation. **You don't have to be a programmer to do this on your own**, you just have to be able to follow instruction (but I mean, it helps if you are one).

## Things you'll need

* Basic understanding of [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), it's really not that hard.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Ability to use the terminal without fainting.
* Your own domain, not necessary but helps remember your website's name.
* A github account, also not necessary but _hugely_ helpful.
