# Chapter 5 & 6 - Civil Liberties 

## Opening Remarks
Civil Liberties and Civil rights are characteristics of every democracy.

Civil Liberties are about the freedoms and rights that individuals have. The government may not infringe upon these rights. These rights are discussed primarily in the US Constitution's Bill of Rights. The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, protects citizens against state infringements of the rights and liberties guaranteed in the Constitution. Civil liberties are - individual rights protected by law from unjust governmental or other interference.

Civil Rights are laws and policies passed by the government to ensure that everyone has the ability to enjoy the rights of citizens of political and social freedom and equality without discrimination.

The whole history of civil rights is about minorities fighting for rights that are Constitutionally granted to them but are denied to them by society.
