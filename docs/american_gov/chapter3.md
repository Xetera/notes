##### † It's more like an 85% - 15% divide in the US now with federalism. {docsify-ignore}

## Unitary
Most popular very centralized power, govt. makes policy for the entire nation.

### Examples
* Most of the countries of the world have a unitary government.

## Confederation
States have more autonomy and are not tied to a central government. Very rare.

### Examples
* Switzerland... except not really so basically no country today.

## Federalism
Power is divided between central government and loal states. States have autonomy to make their own laws but they cannot pass laws that would violate a superior law.

  * There are term limites for each senate assemblymen and each state senator.
  * A governor and deputy governor who is independently elected.
2. **Revenue Powers:** Regional govts. must be able to raise their own taxes.

(Again, missing some notes here, hmu fams)

### Why Federalism in the US?
Federalism is best suited for the US because:

* It is a huge nation, very difficult for a centralized govt to rule efficiently.
* It is a very diverse nation, the most diverse in the world. Federalism allows this diversity to continue, people can identify with their specific enthicity and still identify as American. They don't feel that the central government is trying to eradicate their ethnicity.
* The US was the first country in the world to establish a federal form of govrt. **Motivations for establishing federalism rather than a unity government were:**
  * Would prevent the central govt. from becoming all powerful, thus would protect the rights of of man.
  * Would appeal more to those elites who feared the stronger centralized govt. as established in the Constutiton would violate the rights of man. **Thomas Jefferson** and **Patrick Henry** in particular wanted guaranteed powers for the states.
