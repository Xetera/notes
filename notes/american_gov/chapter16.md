# Chapter 16 - The Judiciary 

## Opening Remarks
* Founders did not expect a major policy role for the federal courts
* Traditinal views: judges find and apply law
* Supreme Court is the only court explicitly mandated by the Constitution

## US Courts

**State courts**

**Municipal courts**

**County courts - 58**

**State supreme courts**

## Federal Courts
**District ourts - 94**
Vast majority of all federal cases begin here (handles breaking of federal criminal laws).

**Courts of appeal - 13**
Appeal from a federal regulatory agency goes here.

**Specialized courts**
Tax courts, customs court, bankruptcy courts.

## Supreme Court

**Members of the lower court**
Nominated by the president senatorial courtesy will ask Senators from state with vacancy who they would like.

**Cases that lower Federal Court can hear**: disputes that violate federal laws, ex. evasion of Federal taxes, money laundering, counterfeit money, transportation of illegal substances across state borders, etc.

**Members of the Supreme Court**
* Chief Justice - Roerts (appointment by George W. Bush, very conservative)
* Alieto 

(oops I missed the rest, you have to know this list tho. It's in your syllabus)

Nominated by the President, confimed by the Senate. Usually Senate will confirm President's choice. It was only with the denial of Bork (Reagan) and then Ginsburg (Reagan) that it became difficult for the president to assume automatically that his choice would be approved. Up until the denial of Bork and Ginsburg, only five judges had been rejected by the Senate.

President usually nominates someone from his own party who shares his same views with the hope that they wil judicate in the president's favor. So if an opening in the Supreme Court occurs, the President can try to ideologically tilt the Supreme Court by nominating someone who shares his views. However, often once appointed to the Supreme Court, judges change their voting habits.

### Types of cases

Each year about 80 cases are heart by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court session always starts the first Monday in October and lasts usually through end of June.

## <span class="fas fa-star" style="color: crimson"></span> Final Question

> [!DANGER]
> Discuss how the Supreme Court works on a case. Please discuss the two ways a case gets to the Supreme Court, what takes place while the Court is hearing the case, how the vote is taken, and finally the different types of opinions the Court may publish. Also discuss what "setting precedent" and "state decisis" mean.

### Original Jurisdiction
Court *must* hear original jurisdictions because there's no other court for them.

Original juristiction makes up about only 2% of the cases the supreme court hears.

* Cases involving disputes between two state governments
* Cases involving foreign diplomats: If a foreign diplomat commits a major crime, they don't get immunity and the cases go to the supreme court.
* Cases involving the US and a state (Trump suing California & back).
* Cases involving a state and a citizen of a different state (if begun by a state).

### Apellate Juristiction
Cases that raise on appeal.

Cases heart on appeal from either state Supreme Courts or US circuit court of appeals or from a Special court if it involves a matter of constitutionality. Supreme Court's of jurisdiction in this areas can be regulated by Congress.

<br>

> [!COMMENT]
> * Congress can change the types of cases that the Supreme Court can hear.
> * Supreme court can get to pick and choose what cases they want to hear on appeal, but **not** original juristictions.

<br>

Petition of Writ of Certiorari (pronounced shersherorii) is given to the court (costs $300 - but if you can't affod it you can file a in forma pauperis for free and have your case heart) - this is the act by which the losing party in a lower court case appeals to the Supreme Court to hear the case to make the facts "more certain".

* Most of the lower cases on appeal come from the federal court of appeals.
* 90% of all Supreme Courts cases are appealed to in this way.
* Court doesn't have to hear a case that it doesn't want to if it's an appeal.

> At least four of the nine justices **have** to agree to hear the case.

Following criteria must be met before the court will take a class on appeal from a lower court:

* Issue must be a fundamental constitutional matter.
* Many similar cases have been litigated.
* There is a conflict of opinion from the lower courts on this issue - Supreme Court will likely hear a case if several of the federal .
* Lower court decision seems to conflict with an earlier Supreme court decision. (example: segregated prom _yeah this is still a thing in some places in the south_)
* Significant individual right is involved.
* Lower court seems to have significantly departed from usual judicial proceedings.
* Case involves an interpretation of a statute never before construed.

### Difficulty getting to court
* Courts rejects between 95% - 98% of applications for certiorari
* High costs
* Each party must pay cost of lawsuit
* Must be a controversy between adversaries
* Personal harm must be demonstrated

### How the supreme court works on a case
There is _no_ jury in the supreme court, only 9 judges.

Cameras or any kind of media are not allowed in supreme courts.

Solicitor General presents the case to the Supreme Court on behalf of the United States if the Federal govt. is one of the aggrieved parties. The solciitor general also decides what cases the government will appeal from lower courts and personally approves or disapproves every case the govt. presents to the Supreme Court.

Judges hear and read arguments by lawyers on each side - lawyers set forth the facts, summarize the lower court decision, give their arguments, and discuss other cases the Court has decided upon that seem to bear on the issue.

Judges question lawyers.

Judges read amicus curiae briefs by interest groups - written opinions on how interested interest groups feel towards the case.


### Discussing the case
Supreme court meets behind closed doors to discuss case.

Chief Justice tries to persuade other judges to support his opinion.

### Voting on a case
Take a vote

Simple majority wins - five justices out of 9

Two main blocks, liberal and conservative.

**Conservatives:** Gorsuch, Roberts, Javanaugh, Thomas, Alito

**Liberals:** Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Ginsberg

They write their opinions on the cases.

### Types of opinions
Majority wins but each person has the opportunity of writing an opinion explaining his decisions.

If Chief Justice is in the majority, he will either write the opinion or assign its writing to a justice who agrees with him. If he is in the minority, the senior justice on the winning side will decide who will write the Court's opinion.

#### 4 Types
* Per curiuam: an unsigned opinion.
* Unanimous opinion: all judges vote the same way - if this happens a strong precedent is created.
* Concurring opinion: an opinion by one or more justices who agree with the majority's conclusion but for different reasons that they with to express.
* Dissenting opinion - the opinion of the justices on the losing side. Dissenting opinions often form the basis of arguments used years layer in reversing the majority opinion in a similar case.

(There was a big paragraph about how the dissenting opinion help changed the views on segregation at some point but it was way too long to type, sorry)

### Legal Terms 

> **Stare decisis** -definition-
>
> "Let the decision stand" means for the court to look to previous cases to look decide. It will look to previous cases to look decide. It will rule on current case how it has ruled in the past on similar cases. The way of interpreting the Constitution doesn't change when the court practices _stare decisis_.


> **Set precendent** -definition-
>
> Means court has changed its mind with regard to past rulings and rules in a new and different way. The court has re-interpreted the Constitution in a new way and as a result, new policy is created.
