# Chapter 5 & 6 - Civil Liberties 

## Opening Remarks
Civil Liberties and Civil rights are characteristics of every democracy.

Civil Liberties are about the freedoms and rights that individuals have. The government may not infringe upon these rights. These rights are discussed primarily in the US Constitution's Bill of Rights. The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, protects citizens against state infringements of the rights and liberties guaranteed in the Constitution. Civil liberties are - individual rights protected by law from unjust governmental or other interference.

Civil Rights are laws and policies passed by the government to ensure that everyone has the ability to enjoy the rights of citizens of political and social freedom and equality without discrimination.

The whole history of civil rights is about minorities fighting for rights that are Constitutionally granted to them but are denied to them by society.

Support your response by giving at least one example of a civil liberty and civil right.

#  Civil Liberties

> ## <i class="fas fa-book icon"></i> Civil Liberties
> Rights given by the government that cannot be infringed upon. Rights to be free of government interference. The rights discussed in the US Bill of Rights' rights are all civil liberties. They each discuss the right of the individual.

The Federal Courts or national government decide to what extent people have civil liberties when they hear court cases about civil liberties.

## Sedition Act 
Passed by Congress in 1798 making it illegal to "write, say or publish any false, scandalous, and malicious writing with the intention of defaming the president, Congress or government."

## Espionage and Sedition Acts
Passed by congress in 1917-1918 - it is a crime to utter false statements that would interfere with the military.

## Libel or slander
A person does not have the right to write or speak in a way that defames the character of another person. But in order for the victim to successful sue the person who committed libel or slander, the victim must prove that they were damaged by the written or spoken words (they lost their job for example). If the person is famous or a celebrity, it is harder for them to win the case, they must prove that the article or spoken words were the result of "actual malice" - meaning the author **intended** to do harm.

## Establishment Clause
Congress cannot make a law establishing a religion. Court further elaborated and stated there "must be a wall of separation" between the government and religion. This court ruling came from Everson vs. Board of Education (1947).

## Free-Exercise Clause
Congress cannot make a law prohibiting the free exercise of a religion.

## Engel v Vitale (1962)
There may not be any kind of prayer, even nondenominational ones in a public school.

# Civil Rights
> ## <i class="fas fa-book icon"></i> Civil Rights
> Civil rights are policies enforced by the government to ensure that there is equality among the people in realizing their civil rights. The purpose of civil rights legislation is to try to prevent or at least limit discrimination against people based on sex, race, or beliefs.

## Black Civil Rights Movement
Movement that gained not only blacks, but all minorities more rights.

### Characteristics
1. Had to first change laws that were purposefully racist against them.
2. Had to then make sure that laws protecting blacks were enforced.
3. Used courts to secure rights.
4. Non-violent protest - Martin Luther King.
5. Violent protest - Malcolm X.
6. Pushed first for political equality, now economic equality.
7. Most successful when rallying around a leader - MLK and Jesse Jackson, and definitely Barack Obama - even though he rarely talked about race and only gave one speech about race during his entire campaign.
8. All blacks supported the movement regardless of age, education, sex (not many blacks who didn't think that they should be given equal rights).
9. Not all blacks supported the tactics used during the Civil Rights movement. Example: MLK Jr. objected to Malcolm X's use of violence. Malcolm X objected to MLK Jr.'s "passivity".


### Slavery Period

Modern slave trade to the US flourished in the late 18th through the early 19th century. In 1776, there was an estimated 500,000 slaves in the US. This is quite a few slaves since the total population in the US was only about 2,500,000 at the time.

Many of our founding fathers were uncomfortable with slavery since it directly violated the principles of freedom and liberty outlined in the Constitution. **Northern states began to free slaves in the late 18th century**. They could afford to free their slaves because slaves were not a key element in their economies. In the north, slaves were often house servants.

In the 1808, the slave trade was officially ended in the US but slavery in the South was still permitted.

Slaves were needed as cheap labor for the southern plantations. Plantation owners in the South found that the native Indians didn't make very good slaves, they kept on dying. So Americans got their slaves from Africa. African slaves seemed to be able to endure long hard work better than native indians.

The southern plantation owners like Thomas Jefferson believed that **without slaves, there was no way that they could make a profit**. They may have been in their hearts opposed to slavery but they were also opposed to losing their plantation profits so they kept slavery legal even when the northern states had outlawed it.

In 1864 Lincoln signed and Congress passed the Emancipation Proclamation - which abolished slavery but it didn't really take affect until the North defeated the South in 1865.

### Amendments
* 13th amendment which officially ended slavery. 
* 14th amendment granted blacks citizenship - equal protection clause.
* 15th amendment grants blacks the right to vote.

### Segregation Period
During this period, blacks were effectively kept segregated and denied the vote.

Immediately after it became illegal for people to keep slaves and blacks were given the vote and citizenship, the Southern states tried to get around these laws and they did with the passage of laws called Jim Crow laws which prevented blacks from achieving their voting rights. They were able to get away with these laws because the Supreme Court upheld them.

#### Jim Crow
The laws set up in place to "lawfully" prevent blacks and minorities from voting in an indirect way.

##### Grandfather Clause
It allowed a voter automatic registration if his grandfather had voted prior to 1865 (before the civil war) made difficult for blacks to register to vote because before 1864 the majority of blacks in the US were slaves.

##### Literacy test
Blacks had to read a difficult test while whites were given "Dick and Jane" type of reading.

##### Poll Tax
Had to pay to vote. Former slaves were poor - choice was "feed the family" or vote - most choose to feed the family. Poll tax keep poor whites from voting too.

<hr>

Private intimidation and threats by whites and the Klu Klux Klan prevented blacks from registering to vote. Some Southern towns would publish the names of blacks who tried to register, so that the white community could punish them.

#### Plessy v Ferguson (1896)
Court ruled it legal to segregate blacks from whites as long as facilities were equal.

Hotels, train cars, restaurants, movie theaters, schools, drinking fountains, parks were now all legally segregated the problem was that the white facilities were far superior to black facilities. It may have been separate but it was not equal.

In the early 20th century the modern civil rights movement began to organize.

NAACP organized in 1909 in an effort to get rights for blacks through use of the legal system. Take discrimination cases to the court. Supreme Court began to slowly rule Jim Crow laws as unconstitutional.

Urban League organized in 1911 organized by whites to improve the living conditions of blacks.

Armed forces desegregated in 1948 by

> ### <i class="fas fa-book icon"></i> Redlining
> Real estate were segregated by race indirectly, forcing colored people to be segregated into their own communities despite being able to afford housing in primarily-white neighborhoods.

### Integration Period

#### Brown v The Board of Education
May 1954 Supreme Court states that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional under the 14th amendment. Later that year courts ruled that racial segregation was unconstitutional in public-housing developments and in public park and entertainment facilities. In Brown v. the Board of Education - the Supreme Court said that segregation was invalid because blacks were not provided equal facilities and these laws demeaned them and denied them their equal rights as American citizens.

#### Rosa Parks
Rosa Parks and the Public Transportation Boycott of 1958. Rosa Parks refused to sit in the black section at the back of a bus. She was arrested. MLK Jr. organized a bus transportation boycott. A year later, Supreme Court outlawed public transportation segregation.

#### Little Rock, Ark. - 1957 
President Eisenhower sent federal troops to Little Rock to compel compliance with a court order requiring the admittance of black pupils into an all-white high schools.

#### Greensboro, NC 1960
Black and white college student stage a series of lunch counter sit-ins. By August, over 70,000 people had participated in sit-ins and over 3500 arrested. Courts ruled that restaurants couldn't discriminate.

#### John Kennedy
John Kennedy campaigns for Civil Rights in 1960, but does little once elected right before he was assassinated in 1963 he sent a major civil rights bill to Congress.

#### Civil Rights Act
Passed by Johnson administration. This assured access to public accommodations. No business could discriminate against blacks or any minority.

#### Voting Rights Act of 1965
Took major steps to assure easy registration for blacks.

#### Major Black Organizations
Basically 2 types of groups, those who wanted to get their rights peacefully and those who advocated using violence.

#### Martin Luther King
MLK, Jesse Jackson, Medgar Evers, advocated peaceful sit-ins and protest to make whites feel guilty for their unequal treatment - in 1963 led a huge march to Washington where he gave his "I have a dream" speech - in 1964 he won the Nobel Peace Prize - effective because it raised the consciousness of white Americans.

Assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee by white assassin James Early Ray in 1968.

#### Black Muslims
Black Panthers led by Malcolm X and Louis Farakan advocated black nationalism and separatism. These organizations felt that the best strategy was through violence. Malcolm X later rescinded his separatist beliefs and formed Organization for Afro-American Unity which advocated racial brotherhood. He was assassinated in 1965 by enemies in the Black Muslims.

Still in the 60's a lot of whites felt that blacks should hav equal rights but they didn't view them as equal to whites.

### Affirmative Action Period
Affirmative action programs were aimed at righting past wrongs against minorities by giving them preferential treatment. Affirmative actions states that when all other factors are equal, preference will be given to the target group.

One justification for affirmative action that first well within the American belief of equality of opportunity is that the compensatory action. Thus if blacks have been discriminated against, government action may legitimately be used to give them things that they would have had in the absence of discrimination.

Some people feel that this is reverse discrimination.

#### Backward Trend?
Middle 80's end of the George W. Bush administration.

Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in 1982 reporter that Reagan administration was trying to reverse the civil rights laws.

In 1982, Reagan moved to allow private schools that practice racial discrimination receive tax exempt status.

Administration opposed amendments that would strengthen some of the original provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

#### Supreme Court Overturn
Supreme Court overturning affirmative action policies and declaring them unconstitutional.

UCs are no longer using affirmative action criteria when accepting a student.

Various state propositions that deny welfare, education, and other social services to illegal aliens - viewed to target minorities.

The last Bush administration has continued to undo the movement to racial equality, claiming that "there is no need for Affirmative Action. Americans are equal".

Hurricane Katrina and the fact that the Bush Administration was very slow to respond to help poor blacks shows that discrimination is still alive and well.

### Obama Period
Great progress made towards the direction of civil rights.

* Gay marriage legalized
* Transgender rights upheld
* Emphasis under Obama wasn't so much pushing for equal rights for every group that faced discrimination - homosexual, transgender, Muslims, women, etc.

### Trump Period
Backward slide in *all* areas - worse backward anti-civil rights trend in US. history

* Racial slurs by the president against women and Mexicans.
* President has a business history of practicing discrimination in terms of hiring, rending out property.
* Got rid of transgender rights making it so that you must be the gender of your birth to serve in the military.
* Trump seemingly seems to not be willing to criticize neo-Nazi or alt-right groups.

### Closing Remarks
Race relations on the decline. In the past whenever economy is in a downturn, racist movements start springing up and racism becomes more blatant. But now unemployment is very low, the economy is booming and racism is much more open now than ever before? Why? Due to Trump. The president sets the moral tone of the country.

<i style="font-size: 11px">I love how we spend every class shitting on this guy lmao</i>

Rise in racism especially among poor, uneducated whites and the very wealthy

Rodney King beating, police shootings of unarmed black men - if you are a black man, the police and society view you as ten times more suspicious then a white and still more likely to be convicted and given much harsher prison sentences than members of any other race.

The majority of crimes committed in America are committed by whites. Yet, if you look at the prison population, you'd think that the majority of crimes are committed by blacks.

There bas been a considerable progress in race relations over the past four decades. However, there is a gap between white and black race relation progress. ith the election of president Obama, many whites in particular feel that there has ben enough progress, equality has been achieved. Blacks on the other hand, still feel that there is a long way to go towards equalizing society.

Many prominent blacks in political spotlight now more than ever in history - Barack Obama is one of the most widely popular presidents domestically and internationally of the 20th and 21st century. Other African Americans either now in political office or were in political office Colin Powell, Condolezza Rice, much of the Obama Administration. Many blacks elected into mayorships or governorships - Tom Bradley (LA), Harold Green (Philadelphia).
