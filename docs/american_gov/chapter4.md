## Opening Remarks 

### Powers of Congress
1. Originally the framers of the Constitution intended congress to be the most powerful branch.
2. With the advent of an international presidency and the overall relatively unchecked growth of presidential power, Congress is no longer more powerful than the executive branch but it is more powerful now than it has ever been.
3. Congress is the most powerful on domestic issues.
4. Congress still has the power to embarrass the president
  * Can conduct investigations of the CIA and of other executive comittes
  * Can refuse to approve of the president's budget and/or severely cut funds.
  * Can refuse to confirm the president's appoint of executive office heads or Supreme Court justices.
  * Can impeach executive officers for wrong-doing, insanity, or incompetence.
  * Congress alone has the right to declare war and ratify treaties, but the president can get around this.

> [!NOTE]
> No other country but the US can investigate a president during their presidency.

### How  Bill Becomes Law

#### Essay Question

<br>

> [!DANGER]
> Discuss how a bill becomes law, discuss the points of death and discuss how the public influences the bill.

![Passing a Law](https://www.lexisnexis.com/help/CU/The_Legislative_Process/bill2law.gif)

#### Points of death
* Speaker of the House
* Committee Chairman (most common point of death)
* Subcommittee Chairman (most common point of death)
* Rules Committee
* Majority Leader

Most bills die in Congress and never become law.

#### Influences of Committees
* If the committee likes the bill they can markup the bill (making it presentable as a legal document).
* Subcommittee can vote to recommend or not recommend the bill, if it's not recommended, it doesn't pass.

> **Quorum** -definition
> 
> The minimum number of members of an assembly that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.

218 house members must be present for the vote to take place.
51 senators are needed for there to be a vote on the bill.

If congress is not in session in 10 days and the bill hasn't been signed, it's a pocket veto.

### Ways to Influence the Bill
* Write the bill (must be sponsored by a Congressman)
* Ask to testify at a committee hearing
* Ask Congressman (letter, e-mail, phone, text) to vote in favor or against a bill
 
### Comments
* Anyone can write a bill but only a congressman can introduce a bill to Congress.
* Speaker of the House assigns bill to a committee in the House, President Pro Tempore assigns the bill to a committee in the Senate.
* A bill not passed in the Congressional session is dead for the rest of the session and cannot be re-introduced.
* A bill can be assigned to several committees.
* Discharge petition or discharge motion used in the House and Senate to force reporting of a bill to the floor.
* Must have a quorum to vote on a bill (**Senate** 51, **House** 218)
* A bill must pass through both houses in exactly the same form.
* All money bills must originate in the House.

### President's Power over Bills
* Sign the bill, it is now law.
* Leave it on his desk and if after 10 days Congress is still in session, it is law.
* Veto the bill - it is not law unless Congress can over-ride the veto with 2/3rds in each house.
* Do nothing and if Congress adjourns before the 10 days are up, it is a pocket veto.

> [!COMMENT]
> It's fairly common to make quorum... unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

### Facts about Committees
House and Senate have similar committees because they both have to look at similar bills.

The party that the majority in each house, also has the majority of members on each committee.

Committee and subcommittee chairmen will be members of the majority party.

#### Committee Assignments
* Committee assignments are determined by the party committee of each house.
  * Republicans assign republicals to committees and democrats assign democrats.
* Committee assignments are based on the following:
  * Congressman's seniority
  * Congressman's constituency - where they're from


> [!NOTE]
> The rules committee is the most powerful committee.

#### Different Types of Committees
* **Standing committees** - permanent committees. The only committees that can research a bill.
* **Ad hoc committees** - They're only there for a little while, after they've carried out their function they disolve..
  * **Joint committees** - members of both the house and senate on it.
    * **Conference committee** - Members of both and senate work together get one version of a bill.
  * **Select committees** - People on the select committee either come from the house or the senate for a specific purpose. (Eg: Trump administration)
* Ethics committee for both house and senate.
* Rules committee

### Criticisms of Congress
1. Congress is fragmented, unresponsive, and it takes a long time to pass a bill. More bills are killed than passed.
Politicans are encouraged to encourage in actions like **logrolling** and **pork barreling**.

> **Logrolling** -definition-
>
> Politicians doing favors for one another _I'll vote for your bill if you vote for mine_

> **Pork Barrelling** -definition-
>
> Politicians putting amendments on bills that only help their own districts using the taxpayer money.

2. Congress isn't maintaining legislative review of the executive branch. This became apparent during the vietnam war when the congress felt like it was difficult to control the president's actions.

#### Attempted Solutions
**Sunshine laws** were passed to expose everything the congress does publicly. All the information is available online etc... *this is the important one*

**Secret ballot of committee chairmen** (I totally zoned out for this one sorry)

**Subcommittees granted more power** to give them more of an incentive to investigate bills.

**War Powers Act of 1973** 60 days after the US troops have been deployed anywhere in the world, the congress can call them back. *this has never been used*

**Establishmend of a Congressional Budget Office for each house** to investigate the budget allocated by the president.
