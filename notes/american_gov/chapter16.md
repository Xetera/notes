(oops I missed the rest, you have to know this list tho. It's in your syllabus)

Nominated by the President, confimed by the Senate. Usually Senate will confirm President's choice. It was only with the denial of Bork (Reagan) and then Ginsburg (Reagan) that it became difficult for the president to assume automatically that his choice would be approved. Up until the denial of Bork and Ginsburg, only five judges had been rejected by the Senate.

President usually nominates someone from his own party who shares his same views with the hope that they wil judicate in the president's favor. So if an opening in the Supreme Court occurs, the President can try to ideologically tilt the Supreme Court by nominating someone who shares his views. However, often once appointed to the Supreme Court, judges change their voting habits.
